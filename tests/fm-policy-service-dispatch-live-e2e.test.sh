# governor-admission

This skill is the single owner of profile selection for the intake that names it.
Run `policy-axi --candidates <json>` exactly once, passing the complete candidate
array you were handed as one compact JSON array, in the order you received it.
Never drop, reorder, or preselect a candidate before that call.
The command prints either `ROUTE <harness>/<model>/<effort>` or `NO_ROUTE <reason>`.
Report that answer as the policy result and never substitute your own choice for it.
